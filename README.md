# Aviso Core

Aviso Core provides Django REST endpoints and utilities for managing drilldown fields, hierarchies, and related data processing as a pluggable Django application that can be embedded into a larger Django project.

## Key idea

This repository contains a reusable Django app. We can install it into Aviso-infrastructure and wire up its URLs and settings. It includes API views under `api/` useful utilities under `utils/`.
